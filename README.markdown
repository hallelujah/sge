# SGE library for ruby

This is used to parse SGE output from qacct and qstat -xml and load them into ruby objects


# Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.

* Make your feature addition or bug fix.

* Add tests for it. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version unintentionally.

* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)

* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
